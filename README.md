# Python-for-Everybody-Specialization-Coursera-
This repository contains all of the assignments that I completed as part of the Python for Everybody Specialization on Coursera.

The specialization is offered by the University of Michigan and consists of five courses:

   1. Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)
   2. Python Data Structures
   3. Using Python to Access Web Data
   4. Using Databases with Python
   5. Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python.

  The assignments are in the assignments folder. Each course has its own folder, and each assignment has its own file. The files are all in Python, and they are named according to the assignment number.

For example, the assignment for Week 1 of the first course is named 1.py.

I hope this repository is helpful to others who are learning Python.
